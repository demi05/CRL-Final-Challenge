# CRL-Final-Challenge
This challenge is from Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts course. 
I learnt a lot during this course such as
-understanding and implementing flexbox
-creating responsive navigation bars
-understanding why to not use fixed width and height
-understanding that all websites are responsive with just HTML.
I learnt these and many more. 
It really was an amazing course. Paced so learning can be assimilated better.
Thanks to Kevin Powell for creating it.
